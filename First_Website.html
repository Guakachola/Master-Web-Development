            <h4 id="title">Day in the Life of a PeaShooter</h4>
        <p title="This was made with chat gpt dont tell anyone" class="long_and_skinny">In a shocking turn of events, the peaceful world of herbs has been thrown into chaos as scallions and garlic rise up against their leafy counterparts. 
            What was once a harmonious garden has now become a battleground for supremacy in the culinary world.
            In the sprawling garden, the pea shooter woke up with the first rays of sunlight, ready for another day of defending its beloved turf. 
            As the morning dew glistened on its leaves, the pea shooter stretched its thin stem and surveyed the surroundings. 
            It knew that lurking beyond the garden's borders were hordes of zombies, hungry for the taste of its cherished plants.</p>
        <p class="long_and_skinny">With determination in its eyes, the pea shooter stood tall, its pea pods filled to the brim. As the zombies began their relentless march, the pea shooter wasted no time. 
            It spat out a rapid succession of peas, each propelled with remarkable precision. The peas soared through the air, finding their marks and slowing the advancing undead. 
            The pea shooter's heart swelled with pride as it held the line, protecting its fellow plants from harm.</p>
        <p class="long_and_skinny">As the day wore on, the pea shooter never wavered. Its relentless barrage of peas continued, providing a steady stream of defense against the relentless zombies. 
            The garden remained a sanctuary of vibrant colors and delicate fragrances, thanks to the unwavering dedication of the pea shooter. 
            And as the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow across the garden, the pea shooter rested, knowing it had fulfilled its duty and safeguarded the beauty that surrounded it.</p>
